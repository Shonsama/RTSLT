# RTSLT-Real Time Sign Language Typing
Real-Time_Sign_Language_Typing(RTSLT) is a software solution that enables deaf and mute individuals to communicate through sign language by machine vision. 

RTSLT uses YOLO to recognize and interpret American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real-time. By detecting and processing hand gestures, the system translates the input into text, which can then be displayed on a screen or transmitted through a communication channel. RTSLT is a practical and effective way to help deaf and mute individuals to communicate with others through sign language in a more efficient and intuitive way.
